Keylogger Detection Using Machine Learning

The dataset for this project can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/keylogger-detection.

This project uses a basic machine learning approach to detect keylogging malware.

Keylogger: A malicious program that secretly records keystrokes on the victim's machine and exfiltrates them. It can be used to steal credentials, spy, etc.

Importance of False Negatives in Cybersecurity

One false negative (i.e., the failure of the model to detect a keylogger) means that a malicious keylogger (or any other malware) could enter the system or network and cause irreversible damage by leaking sensitive information (credentials, activities, etc.).
Thw aim of leveraging AI and ML in cybersecurity should be to minimize the false negatives of the model.
