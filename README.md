keylogger detection using Machine learning

dataset for this project can be found here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/keylogger-detection

This project uses a basic Machine learning approch to detect keylogging malwares.

Keylogger : a malicious program that secretly records key strokes of the the victim's machine and exfiltrates it, it can used to steal credentials , spying etc.

importance of false negatives in cybersecurity

one false negative would mean that a Malicious keylogger(or any other malware) can enter the system,networks etc and cause irreversible damage.
that's instead of just improving the accuracy of the model its important to minimize the false nagative of the model.
