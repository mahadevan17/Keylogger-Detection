keylogger detection using Machine learning

dataset for this project can be found here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/keylogger-detection

This project uses a basic Machine learning approch to detect keylogging malwares.

Keylogger : a malicious program that secretly records key strokes of the the victim's machine and exfiltrates it, it can be used to steal credentials , spying etc.

importance of false negatives in cybersecurity

one false negative (i.e. failiure of model to detect keylogger) would mean that a Malicious keylogger(or any other malware) can enter the system,networks etc and cause irreversible damage by leaking out sensitive information(Credentials, activities etc).
that's instead of just improving the accuracy of the model its important to minimize the false negatives of the model.
